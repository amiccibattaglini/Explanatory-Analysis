# Explanatory-Analysis
This repository contains a class used for exlanatory data analysis and a simple example of usage with stock prices from General Motors.
This repository provides a Python class, `ExplanatoryPlots`, designed to simplify the creation of QQ-plots and Half-Normal plots for exploratory data analysis. 
These visual tools help assess how well your data fits a theoretical distribution â€” typically the Normal or t-Student distribution.
The class was inspired by the techniques introduced in Statistics and Data Analysis for Financial Engineering by David Ruppert. 
While studying, I often forgot the `scipy.stats.probplot()` syntax, so I decided to build my own intuitive and customizable alternative.
